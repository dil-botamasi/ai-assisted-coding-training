# Todo App with Atlas UI

![CI Status](https://github.com/dil-asomlai/ai-assisted-coding-training/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

A React-based Todo application built with TypeScript, Material UI, and Atlas UI components. This project demonstrates modern React development practices with proper state management, component architecture, and comprehensive testing.

## Features

- ✅ Create, read, update, and delete todo items
- ✅ Mark todos as completed
- ✅ Session persistence (survives page refreshes)
- ✅ Responsive design with Material UI
- ✅ TypeScript for type safety
- ✅ React Context for state management
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ Prettier and ESLint for code quality
- ✅ Husky pre-commit hooks
- ✅ GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dil-asomlai/ai-assisted-coding-training.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd ai-assisted-coding-training

- `npm run format` - Format code with Prettier
- `npm run test` - Run tests
- `npm run preview` - Preview production build locally

## Project Structure

The project follows a feature-based organization:

```

├── assets/                      # Media assets
├── components/                  # React components
├── contexts/                    # React contexts
├── providers/                   # React providers
├── types/                       # TypeScript type definitions
└── ...
```

## Session Persistence

The Todo application automatically saves your todos to browser session storage, ensuring your list persists across page refreshes within the same browser session.

### Scope and Limitations

- **Scope**: Todos are stored in `sessionStorage` and will persist through page refreshes, navigation within the app, and browser tab reloads
- **Limitations**:
  - Data is cleared when the browser tab/window is closed
  - Data is not shared between different browser tabs or windows
  - Storage is limited by browser quota (typically 5-10MB)
  - Data corruption or quota errors are handled gracefully with user notifications

### Error Handling

The app includes robust error handling for storage issues:

- Corrupted data is automatically cleared and the app continues with an empty state
- Storage quota exceeded errors display a warning toast while maintaining functionality
- All storage operations are wrapped in try-catch blocks to prevent crashes
